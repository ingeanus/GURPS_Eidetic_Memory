# GURPS_Eidetic_Memory
This is going to be a compilation of many of the Pyramid Article (And maybe some other books too) rulesets that allow you to create items, armour, weapons, and more. Currently just beginning in development though!

To Download, go to : https://github.com/ingeanus/GURPS_Eidetic_Memory/releases

Then, click on the latest .7z file.

Extract the files.

Then you're good, just run the .exe to start!

Don't forget that it is currently under construction so there are lots of bugs (Especially if you do not add the information Left to Right!)
