# GURPS_Eidetic_Memory
This is going to be a compilation of many of the Pyramid Article (And maybe some other books too) rulesets that allow you to create items, armour, weapons, and more. Currently just beginning in development though!

How to Download and Install :

Go to : https://github.com/ingeanus/GURPS_Eidetic_Memory/releases

Then, click on the latest .7z file.

Extract the files.

Then you're good, just run the .exe to start!

Don't forget that it is currently under construction so there are lots of bugs (Especially if you do not add the information Left to Right!)


Upcoming Features :

Fractional Dice damage on Blasters


Currently Supported Resources : 

Eidetic Memory: Low-Tech Armor Design (Alongside the Silk and Jade materials)

Eidetic Memory: Cutting-Edge Armor Design 

Eidetic Memory: Ultra-Tech Armor Design

Eidetic Memory: Blasters and Laser Design


Intended Expansions :

Douglas Cole's Ballistic Firearm Design (Definitely the simplified version and MAYBE the complex one if I can figure out how to understand it!)

Eidetic Memory: The Deadly Spring (It's bow and crossbow design)

Maybe GURPS 3e Mechas, I've got this one in Spreadsheet format including 4e conversions, but it's not a high priority.

> Let me know of any expansions you would want to see added!
